# Choquet Integral in Ensemble Learning Models for COVID-19 Screening From Chest X-Ray Images

This is a project that applis three different networks (VGG-16, VGG-19, Xception) on a publicly available COVID-19 dataset, and uses the Choquet integral for ensemble to build an optimized model to help identify and diagnose COVID-19.
